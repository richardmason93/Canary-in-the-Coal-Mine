An open-sourced publication designed and compiled for an MA Book Design project in the Department of Typography and Graphic Communication at the University of Reading.


MylesJackman described pornography as ‘the Canary in the Coalmine of Free Speech’ in reference to the UK Government’s new porn block. Amongst it’s description of how it will try to restrict our content-access a convoluted meaning of ‘Pornographic Material’ is written in legalese. A far better explanation is the ‘Miller Test’, three requirements content must fulfil to be classified as ‘obscene’ based largely on community standards, but this localised version can only go so far in the post-digital age.

Despite the monumental scale of the task the UK Government has taken on, the porn block does not cover any social media, leaving a hole in the net for children to see porn. Tumblr decided it would try and help the morale crusade by using machine-learning to ban any adult content on their site. Needless to say it has not worked, and only really succeeded in annoying its users and highlighting the pornbots that have avoided the algorithm.

This publication seeks to draw attention to the problems facing our internet today. Go from here to read more about the challenges and issues of modern censorship and see for yourself the damage and results of broken blocks.
